	"what_is_epub_what_body": "EPUB stands for “electronic publication.” It is a format for ebooks defined by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF), now part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Unlike some proprietary formats, EPUB is based on open web standards such as HTML and CSS, so it can be used by anyone and is supported by a large ecosystem of reading devices and software.",

Inside the file you’ll find HTML for the text, CSS for styling, images, and metadata that describe the book (title, author, language, etc.).

It supports multiple languages, embedded fonts, and rich structure (chapters, sections, notes). Because it’s an open standard, many reading apps and devices support it, and you’re not locked into a single vendor. Libraries and publishers often distribute ebooks in EPUB for these reasons.",
