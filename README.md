## What is EPUB Online Viewer?

EPUB Online Viewer is a web app that lets you read EPUB ebooks directly in your browser. You upload your `.epub` files, and they stay in **your device** so you can open them again whenever you like—no sign-up, no cloud storage, no subscription.

## Benefits

- **Your books stay with you** — Files are stored locally in your browser (on your device). We don’t keep copies on our servers.

- **Works in your language** — The app is available in many languages so you can use it in your preferred language.
- **Full-screen reading** — Switch to full-screen mode for a focused, distraction-free reading experience.
- **Private** — Your EPUBs never leave your device. Everything stays in your browser.
