# Per-artifact rules (optional)
rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep proposals concise (1–2 pages). Focus on why, not how.
    - Capabilities section must use kebab-case names; each becomes a spec.
  design:
    - Align with existing routes under src/routes/ and shared code in src/lib/.
    - IndexedDB and EPUB parsing belong in src/lib/; no server-side book storage.
  specs:
    - Requirement-level only; no implementation details. Use kebab-case spec names.
  tasks:
    - Prefer small, testable chunks. Reference lib/ and route paths explicitly.
